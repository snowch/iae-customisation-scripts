# Customisation scripts for IBM Analytics Engine

The goal of this project is to provide customisation scripts for IBM Analytics Engine that users can easily use without having to modify them.

The customisation scripts are located in the folder [./scripts](./scripts).  These scripts are not intended to be modified by users, instead users are expected to compose these scripts together.

Users will however need to create one script, see [./example-main-script.sh](./example-main-script.sh) for an example.

WARNING: These scripts have not been tested.  They are just prototypes.
